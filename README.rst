`Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension to access the `Austrian ORF radio
stations <https://radiothek.orf.at/>`_.  It provides access to the live streams
and the 7 day archive.

Note that timestamps from the API are somewhat inaccurate (especially on
non-music segments). This can cause a slight glitch between tracks, or in very
few extreme cases the beginning getting cut off. The implementation avoids
cutting off the end of tracks, with the trade off of sometimes appending a few
seconds form the next to the previous.
